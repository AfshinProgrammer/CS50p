#### Description:
The Jarvis phone book application is a program that allows users to manage their contacts. The program begins by greeting the user and waiting for them to press Enter to proceed. It then checks if the user is already authenticated by loading user data from a pickle file. If the user data is found, the program prompts the user to enter their login credentials. If the user is authenticated, it proceeds to the main menu. Otherwise, the program prompts the user to register with the app and saves the user data to a pickle file.
Once the user is authenticated, the program presents the main menu, which allows the user to manage their contacts. The program loads the contacts from a file, displays the number of contacts, and presents a set of options to the user to add, edit, delete, search, or display contacts. The program prompts the user to choose an option and executes the corresponding function based on the user's choice. The program also waits for the user to press Enter before proceeding to the next step.
The program can be terminated by pressing Ctrl+C, which is caught by the KeyboardInterrupt exception, and the program exits gracefully. Overall, the Jarvis phone book application is a simple but useful tool for managing contacts that provides a user-friendly interface and basic functionality for managing contacts.

The code defines two regular expressions, USERNAME_PATTERN and PASSWORD_PATTERN, which are used to validate the format of the username and password, respectively.
